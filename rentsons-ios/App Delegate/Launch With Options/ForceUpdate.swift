// Siren allows 1 day leeway for a new version because it can sometimes take ~24 hours to have the version aggregate through all of the app store correctly. So users will be force updated in 1 day after the release, not immediately. More on this issue here: https://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Siren#words-of-caution

        //Occasionally, the iTunes JSON will update faster than the App Store CDN, meaning the JSON may state that the new version of the app has been released, while no new binary is made available for download via the App Store. It is for this reason that Siren will, by default, wait 24 hours after the JSON has been updated to prompt the user to update. To change the default setting, please modify the value of showAlertAfterCurrentVersionHasBeenReleasedForDays.
